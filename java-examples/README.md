# ðŸš€ Java Code Optimization Examples

This directory contains Java code optimization examples that demonstrate how to use AI assistance to improve code quality, performance, and security in enterprise Java applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

- `scenario1-web-app/` - Spring Boot web application optimization examples
  - `security-remediation/` - Security vulnerability fixes and improvements
  - `service-optimization/` - Performance optimizations for service classes

- `scenario2-data-pipeline/` - Java data processing optimization examples
  - `stream-optimization/` - Optimizing Java Stream API usage for data processing

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started

To run these examples:

1. Ensure you have JDK 17 or higher installed
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean install

# Run tests
mvn test
```

## ðŸ¤– Using GitHub Copilot Agent

For each example, you can use GitHub Copilot Agent to analyze the code and suggest improvements:

1. Open a "before" example file in your IDE
2. Request analysis using a prompt like:
   - "Analyze this code for security vulnerabilities and suggest fixes"
   - "Identify performance bottlenecks in this stream operation"
   - "How can I improve the efficiency of this string processing code?"

3. Apply and test the suggested optimizations
4. Compare with the "after" version to see the differences
