# 🔒 Integrating GitHub Advanced Security, Microsoft Defender, and Sentinel

This guide outlines how to integrate GitHub Advanced Security, Microsoft Defender, and Microsoft Sentinel to create a comprehensive enterprise code security solution as part of your AI-assisted optimization strategy.

## 📋 Overview

An effective enterprise code security strategy requires multiple layers of protection. This integration combines:

- **GitHub Advanced Security**: Providing code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review
- **Microsoft Defender for DevOps**: Offering unified DevOps security management across multiple platforms
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Delivering advanced threat detection, investigation, and response

When integrated with Azure AI Foundry and GitHub Copilot Agent, this security stack provides automated vulnerability detection and remediation as part of your code optimization workflow.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before beginning this integration, ensure you have:

- GitHub Enterprise account with Advanced Security license
- Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Cloud subscription
- Microsoft Sentinel workspace
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Administrative access to your GitHub organization
- Administrative access to your Azure tenant

## 🛠️ Setting Up GitHub Advanced Security

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Advanced Security

1. Navigate to your GitHub organization settings:
   ```
   https://github.com/organizations/YOUR-ORGANIZATION/settings/security_analysis
   ```

2. Under "GitHub Advanced Security," click "Enable for all eligible repositories"

3. If you prefer to enable selectively, go to each repository's "Settings" → "Security" → "Code security and analysis" and enable the features there

### Step 2: Configure Code Scanning

1. In each repository, create a new workflow file at `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`:

```yaml
name: "CodeQL Analysis"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Run weekly

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'java', 'csharp', 'javascript' ]  # Adjust languages as needed

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

2. Commit this file to your repository

3. To customize CodeQL queries, create a `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` file:

```yaml
name: "Custom CodeQL Config"

queries:
  - uses: security-and-quality  # Use the security-and-quality query suite
  - uses: ./custom-queries/     # Add your custom queries

paths:
  - src                         # Only scan code in the src directory
  - lib

paths-ignore:
  - '**/test/**'
  - '**/generated/**'
```

### Step 3: Set Up Secret Scanning
