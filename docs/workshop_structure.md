# Enterprise AI-Assisted Development Workshop Series

## 15-Minute Agentic DevOps Introduction

### Opening: The Developer Productivity Challenge
**Visual: Developer Time Allocation Chart**
- 60% Non-coding tasks (planning, research, evaluation)
- 30% Working on existing code (bug fixing, refactoring, migrations)
- 10% Writing new code

**Key Insight**: Developers spend most time on non-creative tasks that AI can help automate.

### Evolution of DevOps
```
DevOps → DevSecOps → Agentic DevOps
```

**Agentic DevOps Definition**: AI-powered agents operating as members of your development team, automating, optimizing, and accelerating every stage of the software lifecycle.

### Core Components Overview
1. **GitHub Models**: Every developer becomes an AI developer
2. **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode**: Multi-step task execution
3. **Coding Agent**: Autonomous routine task handling
4. **App Modernization**: Accelerated .NET and Java upgrades
5. **SRE Agent**: Production monitoring and optimization

### AI-Native Maturity Model
**Three Dimensions, Five Levels Each:**
- **Developer Productivity**: Limited → Strategic AI Advisor
- **DevOps Lifecycle**: Manual → Enterprise-scale Agentic
- **Application Platform**: Traditional → Multi-Agent Systems

### Workshop Structure

#### Module 1: Environment Setup (15 minutes)
**Objective**: Get everyone working with AI-assisted development

**Step-by-Step Setup:**
1. **GitHub Copilot Installation**
   ```bash
   # Verify GitHub CLI (optional but helpful)
   gh --version
   
   # In VS Code: Install GitHub Copilot extension
   # Ctrl+Shift+P → "Extensions: Install Extensions"
   # Search: "GitHub Copilot"
   ```

2. **Verification Test**
   ```java
   // Create a new file: Test.java
   // Type this comment and wait for suggestions:
   // Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number
   ```

3. **Repository Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paulasilvatech/Code-AI-Dev.git
   cd Code-AI-Dev/basic-workshop
   ```

**Checkpoint**: Everyone should see AI suggestions appearing

#### Module 2: Basic Code Optimization (25 minutes)
**Objective**: Experience AI-assisted code improvement

**Exercise 1: String Performance Optimization**
```java
// BEFORE - Inefficient string concatenation
public class StringProcessor {
    public String processNames(List<String> names) {
        String result = "";
        for (String name : names) {
            result += name + ", ";
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
// Optimize this string concatenation for better performance
```

**Expected AI Suggestion:**
```java
// AFTER - Optimized version
public class StringProcessor {
    public String processNames(List<String> names) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (String name : names) {
            result.append(name).append(", ");
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

**Learning Points:**
- Why StringBuilder is more efficient
- When to use AI for performance optimization
- How to evaluate AI suggestions

**Exercise 2: Input Validation Security**
```java
// BEFORE - Security vulnerability
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public User getUser(@PathVariable String id) {
    String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '" + id + "'";
    return executeQuery(query);
}
```

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
// Fix the security vulnerability in this code
```

**Learning Points:**
- SQL injection prevention
- Parameterized queries
- Security-first development practices

#### Module 3: Practical Applications (35 minutes)
**Hands-on Lab: Optimizing a Simple Web Controller**

**Scenario**: You have a basic REST API that needs optimization

**Starting Code:**
```java
@RestController
public class ProductController {
    
    @GetMapping("/products")
    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        // Multiple issues: no pagination, inefficient query, no caching
        return productService.findAll();
    }
    
    @PostMapping("/products")
    public Product createProduct(@RequestBody String productData) {
        // Issues: no validation, poor error handling
        Product product = parseProduct(productData);
        return productService.save(product);
    }
}
```

**Guided Optimization Steps:**
1. Add input validation with AI assistance
2. Implement pagination
3. Add proper error handling
4. Include basic caching strategy

#### Module 4: Testing AI-Generated Code (10 minutes)
**Objective**: Learn to validate and test AI suggestions

**Key Concepts:**
- Always review AI suggestions before accepting
- Test critical functionality
- Understand the code before implementing

#### Module 5: Wrap-up and Next Steps (5 minutes)
**Key Takeaways:**
- AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement for thinking
- Always validate security-related suggestions
- Start with simple optimizations before complex ones

**Next Steps:**
