#### Scenario 1: Injection Vulnerabilities

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:

1. **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
   - Review Code Scanning findings for SQL injection issues
   - Understand the vulnerability context
   - Use GitHub Copilot to explain the risk and impact

2. **Implement Remediation**:
   - Use GitHub Copilot to suggest secure coding patterns
   - Apply parameterized queries
   - Implement input validation
   - Add security testing

3. **Validate Fixes**:
   - Re-run security scans
   - Confirm vulnerability remediation
   - Document the changes and security improvements

#### Scenario 2: Authentication & Authorization Issues

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:

1. **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
   - Review Code Scanning findings for auth-related issues
   - Analyze access control weaknesses
   - Use GitHub Copilot to understand the vulnerabilities

2. **Implement Remediation**:
   - Apply proper authentication mechanisms
   - Implement authorization checks
   - Secure session management
   - Add multi-factor authentication support

3. **Validate Fixes**:
   - Re-run security scans
   - Test authentication bypasses
   - Document the changes and security improvements

### 5. Agentic Security DevOps (20 minutes)

> Note: This section requires GitHub Copilot Enterprise or Pro+ access.

#### Using GitHub Copilot Coding Agent for Security Automation

1. **Create Security Issue Tickets**:
   - Convert security findings to GitHub issues
   - Include detailed vulnerability information
   - Set security requirements and acceptance criteria

2. **Assign to GitHub Copilot**:
   - Demonstrate assigning security issues to GitHub Copilot
   - Review the agent's security analysis approach
   - Observe autonomous security remediation

3. **Review Security Pull Requests**:
   - Analyze AI-generated security fixes
   - Review secure coding patterns implemented
   - Provide feedback for security improvements

4. **Continuous Security Pipeline**:
   - Set up automated security scanning
   - Configure GitHub Actions for security validation
   - Implement security gates in CI/CD pipelines

### 6. Wrap-up and Discussion (10 minutes)

- Review of security optimizations implemented
- Security posture improvements achieved
- Best practices for ongoing security optimization
- Discussion of challenges and limitations
- Integrating security into the development lifecycle

## Workshop Materials

- Presentation slides
- Sample applications with known security vulnerabilities
- Security scanning configurations
- GitHub Advanced Security setup guides
- GitHub Copilot prompt samples for security remediation
- Before/after code samples with security improvements

## Free Access Options

For participants without full GitHub Copilot access:
- Use the 30-day free trial
