## üîç Key Automation Techniques

### Automated Code Analysis Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-code-analysis.yml
name: AI Code Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday at midnight

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up AI Foundry
        uses: azure/ai-foundry-setup@v1
        with:
          foundry-resource: ${{ secrets.AI_FOUNDRY_RESOURCE }}
      
      - name: Run AI Code Analysis
        id: ai-analysis
        uses: azure/ai-foundry-analyze@v1
        with:
          analysis-type: 'performance'
          target-directories: 'src/main'
          output-file: performance-report.json
      
      - name: Create Optimization PR
        if: success() && github.event_name != 'pull_request'
        uses: github/copilot-agent-action@v1
        with:
          task: "Review the performance-report.json and implement the suggested optimizations"
          task-file: performance-report.json
          create-pr: true
          base-branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
          pr-title: "AI-assisted performance optimization"
```

### Scheduled Performance Optimization

```yaml
# .github/workflows/scheduled-optimization.yml
name: Scheduled Optimization

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 2 AM

jobs:
  optimize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'
          
      - name: Run Performance Benchmarks
        run: mvn clean test -P benchmarks
        
      - name: Generate Performance Report
        run: |
          java -jar benchmarks/target/benchmarks.jar -rf json -rff benchmark-results.json
          
      - name: Analyze and Optimize Code
        uses: github/copilot-agent-action@v1
        with:
          task: "Analyze the benchmark results and optimize the slow performing methods"
          task-file: benchmark-results.json
          create-pr: true
          pr-labels: optimization,automated,performance
```

### Automated Security Remediation

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-remediation.yml
name: Security Remediation

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 1 * * *'  # Daily at 1 AM

jobs:
  scan-and-fix:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Initialize CodeQL
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
        with:
          languages: java, csharp
          
      - name: Run CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
        with:
          output: security-report.sarif
          
      - name: Remediate Security Issues
        uses: github/copilot-agent-action@v1
        with:
          task: "Fix the security vulnerabilities identified in the SARIF file"
          task-file: security-report.sarif
          create-pr: true
          pr-title: "Security vulnerabilities remediation"
          pr-body: "This PR fixes security vulnerabilities identified by CodeQL."
          pr-labels: security,automated
```

## üí° Integration Patterns

### CI/CD Integration Pattern

1. **Commit Triggers Analysis**: On commit or PR, run automated analysis
2. **Performance Threshold Check**: Compare metrics against thresholds
3. **AI Solution Generation**: Use AI to generate optimization solutions
4. **Automated PR Creation**: Create PR with AI-generated fixes
5. **Validation Testing**: Run tests to validate improvements
6. **Human Review**: Optional human review of AI changes
7. **Automated Merge**: Merge if all checks pass

### Scheduled Optimization Pattern

1. **Regular Schedule**: Run on a time-based schedule
2. **Full Codebase Analysis**: Analyze entire codebase
3. **Prioritization**: Identify high-impact areas
4. **Batched Optimizations**: Group related optimizations
5. **Staggered PRs**: Create multiple focused PRs
6. **Update Documentation**: Add performance notes to docs
7. **Report Generation**: Generate optimization reports

## ü§ñ GitHub Copilot Agent Prompts

When working with these examples, try using these prompts with GitHub Copilot Agent:

- "Set up a workflow that automatically analyzes code performance weekly"
- "Create a GitHub Action that uses AI to optimize code and create PRs"
- "How can I automate security vulnerability remediation with Copilot Agent?"
- "Set up an Azure DevOps pipeline for continuous code quality improvement"

## üìä Automation Benefits

Setting up AI automation workflows provides significant benefits:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Time Savings | 85% reduction in manual optimization effort |
| Consistency | Uniform application of best practices |
| Early Detection | Issues identified before they impact production |
| Continuous Improvement | Ongoing optimization without manual intervention |
| Knowledge Sharing | Automated PRs serve as learning opportunities |
